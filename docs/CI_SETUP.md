# GitHub Actions CI Setup Summary

This document summarizes the GitHub Actions CI setup implemented for the power-playlists repository.

## CI Workflow Features

### Automation
- **Trigger**: Runs on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop` branches
- **Multi-Python Support**: Tests against Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- **Modern Tooling**: Uses `uv` package manager for fast, reliable dependency management

### Quality Gates

1. **Dependency Installation**: Installs all project dependencies including dev tools
2. **Testing**: Runs all test modules
3. **Linting**: Enforces code quality with ruff (catching critical errors)
4. **Formatting**: Ensures consistent code formatting across the codebase
5. **Type Checking**: Runs mypy for type safety (informational for now)

### Ruff Configuration
- Configured to catch critical issues while remaining practical
- Focuses on: import errors, syntax errors, undefined names, invalid escapes
- Temporarily allows star imports and type comparison styles for gradual improvement
- All formatting rules enforced

### MyPy Configuration  
- Currently permissive to avoid blocking CI on legacy type issues
- Ignores missing imports for third-party libraries without stubs
- Ready to be made stricter as codebase improves

## Current Status

âœ… **Working**: 
- CI pipeline passes successfully
- All tests running and passing
- Critical linting rules enforced
- Code formatting enforced
- Multi-Python version support

ðŸ”„ **In Progress**:
- Gradual increase in linting strictness
- Type annotation improvements

## Enforcement

The CI will **block merging** if:
- Tests fail
- Critical linting violations are found (undefined names, syntax errors, etc.)
- Code formatting is inconsistent

The CI will **warn but not block** if:
- MyPy finds type issues (temporary, will become blocking later)

## Commands for Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run linting
uv run ruff check .

# Fix formatting
uv run ruff format .

# Check types
uv run mypy src/
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Stricter Linting**: Gradually add more ruff rules
2. **Strict Type Checking**: Enable strict mypy mode
3. **Security Scanning**: Add dependency vulnerability checks
4. **Coverage Reporting**: Add test coverage metrics
5. **Performance Testing**: Add benchmarks for critical paths
