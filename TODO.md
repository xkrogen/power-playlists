Main todos:
- Auto-create `~/.power-playlists` if necessary
  - `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/<user>/.power-playlists/app.log'`
- Publish to PyPI
- Publish to Homebrew as a Tap
- Create a samples/ folder for template examples
- Switch off of using URIs since Spotify made them harder to access
